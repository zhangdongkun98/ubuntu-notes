For simplicity and clarity , unless otherwise noted, we only use the (x, y, z) coordinate as our pointâ€™s channels.





Last but not least, it is worth noting that the state-of-the-art we compare to is a specialized technique for each task, whereas our one model, i.e., DeepSets, is competitive across the board.

In this vein, we extend the analysis of sum-decomposability when continuity is not required.



 Our  work  mirrors(Zhang  et  al.,  2018b)  in  quantifying  the  relationship  be-tween overfitting and the number of training environments,though we additionally show how several methods, includ-ing some more $prevalent$ in supervised learning, can reduceoverfitting in our benchmark.
