This directory contains templates used to generate the CUDA container images.

The legacy directories contain templates used to generate images for CUDA versions prior to 11.2.

The newest template files marked with the "j2" suffix are used to generate images going forward.

This change was done to simplify the templates and allow more precise automation.
